Hi.

This is a repository of miscellaneous sourcemod stuff I've been tinkering with.   Less miscellaneous stuff has its own repository, and/or may be commercially available from http://foo-games.com

It's all in development and might be broken from time to time.  If it is, please report an issue.  

That being said have at 'er.
